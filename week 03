	Harvey:

  It is interesting to see how Harvey described that in the 80s, people had very little experience with computers to it now being something almost everyone has experiences with. It is also interesting to read about Harveyâ€™s passion for computers came from her mom and that launched her career as a digital artist and a game designer.
